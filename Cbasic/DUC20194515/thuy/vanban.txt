An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success the simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems more complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms the paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given goal function an agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works some agents are symbolic and logical some are sub-symbolic artificial neural networks and others may use new approaches the paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields such as decision theory and economics that also use concepts of abstract agents building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration for example because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s
